# what is this 

THis is the VS (visualStudio) Java Code we use in the Modul 321 to send sinus numbers to a specified mysql Broker (On a host or a VM, i did it with vm cuz its easier) depending on the how you did it and with what IDE, this code will be less use for you than for others. Read the doku to understad how i did it. Sry if you cant read english as well i :(

This Code is for my colleagues who are in need of code based help
